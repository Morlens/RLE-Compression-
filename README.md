# RLE Compression Project

A C program that implements Run-Length Encoding (RLE) Compression and Decompression

- The program allows users to compress a string into its RLE format
- It also allows users to decompress an RLE string back to the original text (albeit manually)
- Input is automatically converted to uppercase
